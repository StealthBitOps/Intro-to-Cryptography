- Online hash lookup and base encoders.
- TryHackMe lab – Encrypted challenges and walkthroughs.

#### 🔄 Steps to Remember (_Crypto Concepts_)
1. **Encryption Types** – Symmetric (_AES_) vs Asymmetric (_RSA_).
2. **Hashing** – One-way functions for integrity (_MD5, SHA_).
3. **Encoding** – Reversible formats (_Base64, Hex_).
4. **Attacks** – Brute force, dictionary, and rainbow tables.
5. **Practical Application** – Decode, crack, and analyse encrypted data.
